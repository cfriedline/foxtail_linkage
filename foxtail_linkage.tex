  Explaining the origin and evolutionary dynamics of the genetic architecture of
  adaptation is a major research goal of evolutionary genetics.  Despite
  controversy surrounding success of the attempts to accomplish this goal, a
  full understanding of adaptive genetic variation necessitates knowledge about
  the genomic location and patterns of dispersion for the genetic components
  affecting fitness-related phenotypic traits. Even with advances in next
  generation sequencing technologies, the production of full genome sequences
  for non-model species is often cost prohibitive, especially for tree species
  such as pines where genome size often exceeds 20 to 30 Gbp. We address
  this need by constructing a dense linkage map for foxtail pine (\textit{Pinus
    balfouriana} Grev. \& Balf.), with the ultimate goal of uncovering and
  explaining the origin and evolutionary dynamics of adaptive genetic variation
  in natural populations of this forest tree species. We utilized
  megagametophyte arrays ($n$ = 76--95 \si{megagametophytes/tree}) from four
  maternal trees in combination with double-digestion restriction site
  associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) to produce a consensus linkage map
  covering 98.58\% of the foxtail pine genome, which was estimated to be
  \SI{1276}{cM} in length (95\% CI: \SIrange{1174}{1378}{cM}). A novel
  bioinformatic approach using iterative rounds of marker ordering and
  imputation was employed to produce single-tree linkage maps
  (\num{507}--\num{17066} contigs/map; lengths: 1037.40--1572.80 cM).  These
  linkage maps were collinear across maternal trees, with highly correlated
  marker orderings (Spearman's $\rho > 0.95$).  A consensus linkage map derived
  from these single-tree linkage maps contained 12 linkage groups along which
  \num{20655} contigs were non-randomly distributed across 901 unique positions
  ($n = 23$ contigs/position), with an average spacing of \SI{1.34}{cM} between
  adjacent positions. Of the \num{20655} contigs positioned on the consensus
  linkage map, 5627 had enough sequence similarity to contigs contained within
  the most recent build of the loblolly pine (\textit{P. taeda} L.) genome to
  identify them as putative homologs containing both genic and
  non-genic loci. Importantly, all 901 unique positions on the
  consensus linkage map had at least one contig with putative homology to
  loblolly pine.  When combined with the other biological signals that
  predominate in our data (e.g., correlations of recombination fractions across
  single trees) , we show that dense linkage maps for non-model forest tree
  species can be efficiently constructed using next generation sequencing
  technologies. We subsequently discuss the usefulness of these maps as
  community-wide resources and as tools with which to test hypotheses about the
  genetic architecture of adaptation.

\section*{Introduction}

Evidence for adaptive evolution among populations of plants is commonly
documented at both the phenotypic and molecular levels \citep{Kawecki:2004,
  Pannell:2013}, so that some of the best examples of adaptive evolution within
lineages come from the field of plant genetics \citep[e.g.,][]{Antonovics:1970}.
Despite this evidence, relatively little work has focused explicitly on the
genomic organization of loci contributing to these patterns
\citep{Hoffman:2008}, which likely stems from a lack of genomic resources
for plants relative to animals.  Adaptive evolution has been extensively
documented for forest trees, especially conifers, with many instances of local
adaptation clearly documented over the past century \citep{White:2007,
  Neale:2011}. Despite great advances in experimental technology, empirical
focus has remained almost fully on the number, effect size, type, and
interactions among loci contributing to adaptive evolution \citep{Neale:2011,
  Alberto:2013}.  A thorough examination of the genetic architecture of
fitness-related traits, however, should also include an examination of the
genomic organization of the loci contributing to trait variation. We
leverage this idea in the first of a series of papers dissecting the genetic
architecture of fitness-related traits in a non-model conifer species, foxtail
pine (\textit{Pinus balfouriana} Grev.\  \& Balf.).

The genomic organization of loci contributing to variation in
fitness-related traits would follow naturally from the production of a genome
sequence (i.e., a physical map). For many taxa, especially those with small to
modest genome sizes, this is monetarily and computationally feasible using
next-generation DNA sequencing technologies \citep{Koboldt:2013}. For taxa with
large or complex genomes, however, even the advent of next generation DNA
sequencing does not solve the complexity and cost hurdles associated with the
production of a finished genome sequence. Conifers have large and complex
genomes \citep{Murray:1998, Ahuja:2005}, with estimated average genome sizes in
\textit{Pinus} in the range of \SIrange{20}{30}{Gbp}. Several genome projects,
each of which involves large consortia, are underway or have been completed
\citep{Mackay:2012}. Even these efforts often initially result in limited
information, however, as for example the current assemblies of the Norway spruce
(\textit{Picea abies} L.) and loblolly pine (\textit{Pinus taeda} L.) genomes
contain millions of unordered contigs with average sizes in the thousands of
base pairs \citep{Nystedt:2013, Neale:2014}. An alternative, but not
mutually-exclusive, approach to describing the genome of an organism is that of
linkage mapping. In this approach, genetic markers are ordered through
observations of recombination events within pedigrees. This approach dates to
the beginning of genetics and the logic has remained unchanged since
the first linkage maps were created in \textit{Drosophila}
\citep{Sturtevant:1913}.

Renewed interest in linkage maps has occurred for two reasons. First, linkage
maps are often used to order contigs created during genome sequencing projects
\citep{Mackay:2012, Martinez-Garcia:2013}. In this fashion, linkage maps are
used to help create larger contigs from those generated during the assembly. It
is these larger contigs that create the utility that most practicing scientists
attribute to genome sequences. Second, linkage maps are easy to
produce and provide a rich context with which to interpret population and
quantitative genetic patterns of variation \citep[e.g.,][]{Eckert:2010a,
  Eckert:2010b, Eckert:2013a, Yeaman:2013}. They can also be used to test
explicit hypotheses about the organization of loci contributing to adaptive
evolution. For example, \citet{Yeaman:2011} developed theoretical predictions
about the genomic organization of loci underlying patterns of local adaptation
as a function of gene flow, so that loci contributing to local adaptation have
differing spatial structure within genomes as a result of differing regimes of
gene flow. The relevant scale \citep[\textit{sensu}][]{Houle:2011} in these
mathematical formulations is that of recombinational distance among loci, so
that when matched with an appropriate study system, linkage maps provide the
impetus to test basic evolutionary hypotheses. In this context, future additions
of finished genome sequences would add to the interpretation of results.

Construction of linkage maps have a long history within forest genetics, mostly
through their use in quantitative trait locus mapping
\citep{Ritland:2011}. Conifers in particular are highly amenable to linkage
mapping, with approximately 25 different species currently having some form of
linkage map completed \citep[see Table 5-1 in][]{Ritland:2011}. Much of the
amenability of conifers to linkage mapping stems from the early establishment of
breeding populations in economically important species and from the presence of
a multicellular female gametophyte (i.e., the megagametophyte) from which the
haploid product of maternal meiosis can be observed
\citep{Cairney:2007}. Indeed, many of the first linkage maps in conifers were
generated from collections of megagametophytes made from single trees
\citep{Tulsieram:1992, Nelson:1993, Kubisiak:1996}. Continued advancements in
genetic marker technologies have facilitated rapid development of linkage maps
across a diversity of species, with the largest maps generated for economically
important species \citep[e.g.][] {Achere:2004, Kang:2010, Martinez-Garcia:2013}.
The development of biologically informative markers for non-economically
important conifers, however, is hampered by production costs associated with the
creation of characterized genetic markers (i.e., those with a known DNA
sequence and/or function).  The majority of this cost is in the two-step
approach needed to generate biologically meaningful markers: polymorphism
discovery via DNA sequencing followed by genotyping of those polymorphisms
\citep[cf.,][]{Eckert:2013a}. As a result, the vast majority of linkage maps
outside of economically important species are created with uncharacterized
genetic markers \citep[e.g.,][]{Travis:1998}. Much of the knowledge about the
genetic architecture of fitness-related traits, outside of a handful of
economically important conifer species, therefore, encompasses the number and
effect size of uncharacterized genetic markers \citep{Ritland:2011}. Cost
restrictions, however, have largely disappeared.  It is now feasible to jointly
discover polymorphisms and genotype samples using high-throughput DNA sequencing
approaches, such as restriction site associated DNA sequencing \citep [RADseq;
e.g.,][] {Peterson:2012}.

The generation of linkage maps from RADseq data is a complex endeavor due to the
inherent stochasticity and error prone nature of these data. Recent examples in
several crop species highlight the difficulties that must be overcome with
respect to missing data and errors in calling polymorphic sites and the
resulting genotypes \citep{Pfender:2011, Ward:2013}. Despite these difficulties,
RADseq has been successively applied to samples taken from natural populations
of non-model conifer species \citep{Parchman:2012}, but has yet to be applied to
linkage mapping in these species. An exploration of these methods to
linkage mapping in the large and complex genomes of conifers is thus warranted. Here,
we take this approach using megagametophyte arrays from four maternal trees of
foxtail pine to generate maternal linkage maps. There are currently no published
linkage maps for this species, which is only distantly related to loblolly pine
\citep{Eckert:2006a}, nor any within the subsection \textit{Balfourianae}.  We
subsequently discuss the utility of our inferred linkage maps to tests of
evolutionary theory addressing local adaptation and its genetic architecture.


\section*{Materials and Methods}\label{ss:mats}

\subsection*{Focal species}
Foxtail pine is a five needle species of \textit{Pinus} classified into
subsection \textit{Balfourianae}, section \textit{Parrya}, and subgenus
\textit{Strobus} \citep{Gernandt:2005}. It is one of three species within
subsection \textit{Balfourianae} \citep{Bailey:1970} and generally is regarded
as the sister species to Great Basin bristlecone pine
\citep[\textit{P. longaeva} D. K. Bailey; see][] {Eckert:2006a}. The natural
range of foxtail pine encompasses two regional populations located within
California that are separated by approximately \SI{500}{km}: the Klamath
Mountains of northern California and the Sierra Nevada of southern California
(Figure \ref{f:Figure01_TGG}). These regional populations diverged approximately
one million years ago (mya), with current levels of gene flow between regional
populations being approximately zero \citep{Eckert:2008}. Within each regional
population, levels of genetic diversity and the degree of differentiation among
local stands differ, with genetic diversity being highest in the southern Sierra
Nevada stands and genetic differentiation being the highest among the Klamath
stands \citep{Oline:2000, Eckert:2008}. These two regional populations have also
been recognized as distinct subspecies based on numerous quantitative traits,
with \textit{P. balfouriana} subsp.\ \textit{balfouriana} located in the Klamath
region and \textit{P. balfouriana} subsp.\ \textit{austrina} located in the
southern Sierra Nevada mountains \citep{Mastrogiuseppe:1980}. The two regional
populations of foxtail pine thus represent a powerful natural experiment within
which to examine the genomic organization of loci contributing to local
adaptation. The first step in using this system to test evolutionary hypotheses
is the production of a dense linkage map \citep[cf.,][]{Pannell:2013}.

\subsection*{Sampling}
Seed collections from 141 maternal trees distributed throughout the natural
range of foxtail pine were obtained during 2011 and 2012. Of these 141 maternal
trees, 72 were sampled from the Klamath region, while 69 were sampled from the
southern Sierra Nevada region. These 141 families were divided among 15 local
stands ($n = \text{\SIrange{4}{17}{trees/stand}}$), with eight stands in the
Klamath region and seven stands in the southern Sierra Nevada.  Approximately 50
seeds were germinated from each seed collection and 35 of those 50 seedlings
were planted in a common garden located at the USDA Institute of Forest
Genetics, Placerville, California (Figure \ref{f:Figure01_TGG}). The common
garden was established using a randomized block design and involved three
separate plantings of seeds spanning approximately one year (June 6, 2012
until May 20, 2013). Four of the 141 maternal trees were selected at random ($n =
2$ from the Klamath region and $n = 2$ from the southern Sierra Nevada) for
linkage analysis. Libraries were color-coded and are referred to as red
(southern Sierra Nevada), green (southern Sierra Nevada), blue (Klamath), and
yellow (Klamath).  For each of these trees, \SIrange{75}{100}{} seeds were
germinated and planted in the common garden.  Upon germination, haploid
megagametophyte tissue was rescued from each seedling, cleaned by removing soil
and other extraneous materials with water, and stored for further analysis in
\SI{1.5}{\mL} Eppendorf tubes at \SI{-20}{\celsius}.

\subsection*{Library Preparation and Sequencing}
Total genomic DNA was isolated from each rescued megagametophyte using the
DNeasy 96 Plant kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Germantown,
MD). RADseq \citep{Davey:2010, Parchman:2012, Peterson:2012} was used to
generate a genome-wide set of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for
linkage mapping following the protocol outlined by \citet{Parchman:2012}. In
brief, this protocol is a double-digestion, RADseq (ddRADSeq) approach based on
digestion of total genomic DNA using EcoRI and MseI followed by single-end
sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Following digestion, adapters
containing amplification and sequencing primers, as well as barcodes for
multiplexing, were ligated to the digested DNA fragments. We chose to multiplex
96 samples using the barcodes available from \citet{Parchman:2012}. One of these
samples, per set of 96, was a pseudo-diploid constructed by pooling five
megagametophytes sampled from the same maternal tree, although there is a
probability of $0.5^{4} = 0.0625$ that the genotype for any given SNP will be
mistakenly called homozygous due to the five megagametophytes all being of the
same allele \citep[see][]{Morris:1978}.  These barcodes are a mixture of
\SI{8}{bp}, \SI{9}{bp}, and \SI{10}{bp} tags that differ by at least four bases.
Following ligation, successfully ligated DNA fragments were amplified using PCR
and amplified fragments were size selected using gel electrophoresis. We
selected fragments in the size range of 400 bp (\SIrange{300}{500}{bp}) by
excising and purifying pooled DNA from 2.5\% agarose gels using QIAquick Gel
Extraction Kits (Qiagen). Further details, including relevant reagents and
oligonucleotide sequences, can be found in File S1. All DNA sequencing was
performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 or 2500 platform at the VCU Nucleic Acids
Research Facility (\url{http://www.narf.vcu.edu/}).

\subsection*{DNA Sequence Analysis}\label{ss:dna}
There are multiple steps involved with the processing of raw DNA sequence reads
into a set of SNP genotypes that are useful for linkage mapping: (1) quality
control, filtering, and demultiplexing, (2) assembly to generate a reference
sequence for mapping reads, (3) mapping of reads to call SNPs and genotypes for
each sample, and (4) filtering of SNPs and the resulting genotypes for data
quality and biological meaning.

DNA sequence reads were demultiplexed into sample-level fastq files, following
quality control and filtering.  The filtering pipeline was adapted from
\citet{Friedline:2012fm}. Briefly, reads containing any N beyond the
first base were excluded, however, reads having N as the first base were shifted
by one base to the right to exclude it (i.e, a read starting with NTGC would
become a read starting with TGC).  Additional quality filtering ensured that all
reads in the resulting set for downstream processing had a minimum average
quality score of 30 over 5-bp sliding windows and that not more than
\SI{20}{\percent} of the bases had quality scores below 30. Reads passing the
quality control steps were demultiplexed into sample-specific fastq files by
exact pattern matching to known barcodes. Reads that did not match a known
barcode were excluded.

The individual with the largest number of reads across all four maternal trees
was assembled using Velvet (Zerbino, version 1.2.10), with hash length ($k$)
optimized using parameter sweeps of $k$ through the contributed
\texttt{VelvetOptimiser} (\url{http://www.vicbioinformatics.com}, version 2.2.5)
script (for odd $k$ on $k=[19,63]$).  Assembly robustness was evaluated in each
case using the LAP likelihood framework \citep{Ghodsi:2013bc}, version 1.1 (svn
commit r186) following mapping of the original reads to the assembly with
Bowtie2 \citep{Langmead:2012jh} (\texttt{--local --very-sensitive-local}).  The
assembly with the maximum likelihood value was chosen as the reference for SNP
calling.

SNPs were called for all individuals against the reference using the following
methodology.  First, reads were mapped to the reference with \texttt{Bowtie2}
(\texttt{--local --very-sensitive-local}).  These resulting sam files were
converted to their binary equivalent (e.g., bam) using \texttt{samtools} version
0.1.19 (\texttt{view, sort, index}) \citep{Li:2009ka}.  SNPs were called using
\texttt{bcftools} and filtered using \texttt{vcfutils} to exclude SNPs with less
than 100x coverage. The resulting variant call files (vcf) were further
processed using \texttt{vcftools} version 0.1.11 \citep{Danecek:2011gz} to
remove indels, exclude genotype calls below a quality threshold of 5, and output
as a matrix (\texttt{--012}) the haploid genotype of each megagametophyte for
each SNP.

We used several thresholds to filter called SNPs for linkage mapping. First, we
excluded SNPs using a $\chi^2$ test of homogeneity against an expectation of 1:1
segregation.  This segregation pattern was expected because the maternal tree
had to be a heterozygote to detect a SNP, and Mendel's first law guarantees that
the segregation ratio for this SNP should be 1:1. Significance of each test was
assessed using a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of $\alpha = 0.05$,
where $\alpha$ was corrected using the number of SNPs tested. As reads from each
family were mapped against a single reference assembly, we performed the
$\chi^2$ test and corrections on a family-wise basis.  Second, for each family,
we filtered the resulting SNPs based on the genotype of the pseudo-diploid
sample in that family so as to keep only those SNPs where the pseudo-diploid was
either 1) called a heterozygote or 2) had a missing genotype call.  Lastly, we
filtered the resulting SNPs so as keep only those that had a minimum of 5
genotype calls for each of the alternate alleles. The resulting subset of SNPs
was then used as the input to linkage analysis.

\subsection*{Linkage Analysis}\label{ss:linkage}
The production of a linkage map requires three main steps: (1)
calculation of pairwise distances between all pairs of loci, (2) clustering
(i.e., grouping) of loci based on these pairwise distances, and (3) ordering of
loci within each cluster \citep{Cheema:2009}.  A variety of software packages
exist to carry out these steps \citep[e.g.,][]{VanOoijen:2011}. Traditional
software packages for linkage mapping, however, are not amenable to large
amounts of missing data and frequent errors in genotype calls. The former causes
issues with all aspects of analysis, while the latter primarily affects the
genetic distances between markers \citep{Hackett:2003, Cartwright:2007}. We thus
followed the approach of \citet{Ward:2013}, which was designed specifically for
RADseq data.

In brief, this method can be described as follows. Pairwise distances were
estimated and loci were clustered using a custom R script \citep{R:2013}. We
used MSTmap \citep{Wu:2008a} to infer marker order and Maskov \citep{Ward:2013}
to impute and correct genotypes. The algorithms available in MSTmap can also be
used to impute and correct genotype errors \citep[see][]{Wu:2008a}, but the
amount of missing data and putative genotyping errors in our RADseq data far
surpassed those used to develop this software. These two programs were used in
an iterative fashion. MSTmap was used initially to order markers, which was
followed by the use of Maskov to impute and correct putative genotype errors
conditional on this initial marker ordering. A last round of ordering was
performed using MSTmap conditional on the imputed and error corrected genotype
data. This general schema was followed for each of the four maternal trees
independently.

The relevant pairwise distance for linkage mapping in our haploid case is
defined as the probability of observing a recombination event between two
haplotypes. This probability can be calculated for a set of biallelic loci using
the Hamming distance ($d_{i,j}$).  The Hamming distance is the number of
differences separating two binary strings \citep{Hamming:1950}, which are in
this case, the haploid genotypes for a set of two megagametophytes.  This
distance, scaled by the number of positions (i.e., $d_{i,j}/n$), is the maximum
likelihood estimate of the probability of a recombination event with respect to
a pair of haplotypes in a double haploid design \citep{Wu:2008a}. It is also an
estimate of the recombination fraction, so that these distances can be
transformed into LOD scores \citep[see][]{Morton:1955}. Missing data were dealt
with in a pairwise manner, so that each pairwise comparison had missing data
removed prior to estimation of $d_{i,j}/n$. When values of $d_{i,j}/n$ exceeded
0.5, which is the theoretical maximum value given the expected 1:1 segregation
pattern, they were set to 0.5.  The $d_{i,j}/n$ values were used to construct
the pairwise distance matrix between all possible pairs of loci passing our
quality thresholds.

Loci were clustered hierarchically based on the pairwise distance matrix using
Ward's method as the linkage function \citep{Ward:1963}.  The values of
$d_{i,j}/n$ were squared prior to use of Ward's method in hierarchical
clustering.  We explored groupings ($K$) based on clustering on the interval
$K=[8,16]$. This interval was chosen because it brackets the haploid chromosome
number of foxtail pine ($1N = 12$). This entailed cutting the resulting
dendrogram at a specific height, so that the desired number of groups resulted.
Solutions were compared using silhouette widths for each locus
\citep{Rousseeuw:1987}.  The value of $K$ which maximized the fraction of loci
for which the silhouette width was maximal across the different values of $K$
was selected as optimal.

Ordering of loci within clusters was carried out using MSTmap
\citep{Wu:2008a}. This method takes a full, undirected graph where nodes are
loci and edges are based on the values of $d_{i,j}/n$ and finds the correct
order of markers based on the minimum-weighted traveling salesman path
(TSP). \citet{Wu:2008a} showed that the minimum-weighted TSP can be found using
a minimum spanning tree approach and that it corresponds to the correct order of
the loci if the minimum spanning tree on the full, undirected graph is
unique. We employed MSTmap using the maximum likelihood objective function,
grouping turned off, imputation of missing data turned off, and the Kosambi
mapping function \citep{Kosambi:1944}. The resulting ordering of loci within
each cluster, along with the distances (i.e., cM) in each cluster, were taken as
the initial linkage map from which data were error-corrected and imputed.

Data were subsequently imputed and corrected for errors using Maskov
\citep{Ward:2013}. A full account of the mechanics used in the algorithm of
Maskov can be found in Text S1 from \citet{Ward:2013}. For our purposes, the
accuracy of the imputation and error correction depends upon two choices: (1)
the threshold for missing data for a given megagametophyte and (2) the number of
contiguous loci where genotype errors can occur. We chose a value equal to 90\%
for the amount of missing data across megagametophytes for the former and a
value of 5\% of the number of loci in the initial map for each cluster for the
latter \citep[cf.,][]{Ward:2013}.

A final round of ordering was conducted with the imputed and error corrected
data using MSTmap as described previously. Imputation and error correction
resulted in many loci where $d_{i,j}/n = 0$. These co-segregating markers were
thus mapped to the same bin \citep{Wu:2008a}. The collection of resulting
ordered clusters was taken as the final linkage map for each of the four
maternal trees.  The end result of the linkage analysis was thus four
independent linkage maps, one per maternal tree.

\subsection*{Consensus Map Construction and Biological
  Interpretation}\label{ss:consensus}
We took a two-step approach to the inference of the consensus linkage
map. First, the four linkage maps, one for each maternal tree, were combined
into a framework linkage map using MergeMap \citep{Wu:2008b}.  We constructed a
set of weights with which to rank SNP orderings from each map as more or less
probable based on the average amount of missing data, where a higher weight
meant that the genotype data used to infer the linkage map had fewer instances
of missing data (red: 0.05, green: 0.40, blue: 0.15, yellow: 0.40). We focused on
only those markers that appeared in three or more of the linkage maps, with the
stipulations that two of the three linkage maps
be those for the green and yellow libraries and that the amount of missing data
in each of the libraries for these markers was $< 20^{th}$ percentile. Second,
the remaining SNPs were added to the framework map by using the weighted average
of the observed recombination fractions across libraries and constructing a
linkage map as described previously based on these weighted average
values. Consistency in the positioning and relative distances among framework
markers was assessed using Spearman \citep{Spearman:1904} and Mantel
\citep{Mantel:1967} correlations. Specifically, pairwise distances (cM) among
framework markers were extracted from each linkage group on the framework map
built using MergeMap as well as the map resulting from use of the weighted
average recombination fractions in MSTmap.  A Mantel correlation was used to
test the null hypothesis that these distances were not correlated using a
Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of $\alpha = 0.05$. Separate tests
were performed for each of the 12 linkage groups. All analysis was conducted in
the R ver. 3.0.2 statistical computing environment \citep{R:2013}.

Framework markers on the resulting consensus linkage map were used to estimate
the size \citep{Chakravarti:1991} and coverage \citep{Lange:1982} of the foxtail
pine genome. The contigs from the assembly used to discover SNPs that appeared
on the consensus linkage map were annotated using BLAST tools
\citep{Altschul:1990vt} and the most recent release of the loblolly pine
(\textit{Pinus taeda} L.) genome sequence (v. 1.01, annotation V2). Each contig
from the assembly was queried against the set of scaffolds comprising the
loblolly pine genome using blastn. The hits from each comparison was retained
and these top hits were filtered based on query coverage and the percent
identity. As a thresholds, we used a minimum of 50\% for the query coverage and
75\% for the percent identity. The percent identity for the query coverage was
set according to the expected number of substitutions between two sequences
\citep[$2 \mu t$, see][]{Nei:1987}, where the mutation rate ($\mu$) was assumed
to be \num{1e-9} \si{substitutions/site/year} and the divergence time ($t$)
was assumed to be \num{8e7} years \citep{Willyard:2007}.  This translated
into an average expectation of 16\% divergence between any two DNA sequences of
loblolly and foxtail pines. We rounded down to 75\% to account for a portion of
the variance around this expectation. Hits that exceeded these thresholds were
transferred as annotations, as obtained from the annotation gff files, to the
contig appearing on the consensus linkage map for foxtail pine. The resulting GO
annotations were visualized and analyzed with ReviGO (Gene Ontology monthly
release 10/2014; UniProt-to-GO mapping 9/30/2014) \citep{Supek:2011bw} allowing
a similarity of 50\% across terms.

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{DNA Sequence Analysis}

The raw number of reads varied across libraries from a minimum of \num{71834280}
(red) to a maximum of \num{206365836} (green), with an average of
\num{153082376} $\pm$ \num{49855941}. All raw reads were either 102 bp (green,
yellow) or 110 (red, blue) in length, depending on sequencing technology (HiSeq
2500 vs 2000, respectively). In general, the libraries run on the Illumina HiSeq
2500 platform had a \num{1.65}-fold greater number of reads than those run on
the Illumina 2000 HiSeq platform. Processing of reads for quality reduced these
numbers by approximately \num{1.66}-fold, with a range of a \num{2.56}-fold
(red) to a \num{1.33}-fold (yellow) reduction. After filtering, the average
length of reads was 88 $\pm$ \SI{13}{bp}, with a range of \SIrange{40}{102}{bp}
across libraries.  The number of quality-filtered reads per megagametophyte also
varied \num{19741}-fold ($\pm$ \num{27069}-fold) on average across libraries,
with average minimums of 753 $\pm$ 603 bp to average maximums of \num{3421571}
$\pm$ \SI{2070990}{bp}. After quality filtering this translated into an average
total of \SI{8137663036}{bp} $\pm$ \SI{3658147958}{bp} generated per library,
ranging from \SI{2436531265}{bp} (red) to \SI{11643165529}{bp} (yellow).

The largest number of reads ($n=\text{\num{6838986}}$) were obtained for a
single megagametophyte in the green library. These reads were used to create an
assembly against which all other data were mapped for SNP calling and genotype
determination. Optimization of assembly parameters ($k=31, lnL=-110.071)$,
resulted in an assembly of \num{231053} contigs, with an average length of 89 bp
$\pm$ 12 bp per contig (range: \SIrange {61}{312}{bp}), and an average
per-contig base coverage of \SIrange{4.5}{20.0}{X} (range:
\SIrange{1.5}{5069}{X}). This assembly represented approximately 0.07\% of the
genome of foxtail pine, which was assumed to be approximately 30 Gbp in size
\citep{Murray:1998}.

Using this assembly, \num{349542} putative SNPs were called (Table 1). These
\num{349542} SNPs were located in \num{83051} unique contigs (35.94\% of the
total), with a mean of \num{4} SNPs per contig (range:
\SIrange{1}{32}{}). Filtering these SNPs by expected segregation patterns,
consistency with heterozygous calls for the psuedo-diploid sample, and minimum
sample sizes for genotype calls, resulted in \num{983}, \num{34261},
\num{21594}, and \num{35304} SNPs for the red, green, blue, and yellow
libraries, respectively. The counts for the yellow and green libraries were also
trimmed so as to remove all but a handful ($n = 2$ for the yellow and $n = 6$
for green libraries) of the unique contigs not found as polymorphic in the other
libraries. This was done to facilitate the efficiency of the calculation of
pairwise recombination fractions. These SNP counts represented \num{507},
\num{16925}, \num{10967}, and \num{17066} contigs for the red, green, blue, and
yellow libraries, respectively. Patterns of shared polymorphic contigs, as well
as SNPs, were as expected given the among-region magnitude of genetic
differentiation \citep[Figure 2, see][]{Eckert:2008}, with libraries comprised
of megagametophytes sampled from maternal trees located in the same geographical
area sharing more polymorphic contigs and SNPs than comparisons of maternal
trees from different geographical regions (nonparametric permutation analysis:
$P < 0.0001$, see Supplemental Text).  On average, megagametophytes in the
filtered data set had 79.40\% ($\pm$ 14.7\%) missing data (i.e., a missing
haploid genotype) across SNPs (range: 1.3\% to 99.8\%), with the green library
having the smallest (74.3\% $\pm$ 18.9\%) and the red library having the largest
average amount of missing data per megagametophyte (84.4\% $\pm$ 15.2\%).

\subsection*{Linkage Mapping}

Individual linkage maps were constructed for each maternal tree separately using
an iterative approach based on imputation. All filtered SNPs for each maternal
tree, regardless of being located in the same contig, were assessed for patterns
of linkage followed by grouping and ordering of SNPs. Redundant SNPs were
filtered \textit{post hoc} and used to test for biases in our analysis pipeline.

Grouping of pairwise recombination fractions via hierarchical clustering was
consistent with \num{12} linkage groups.  This corresponded to a minimum
pairwise LOD score of approximately 5.5 for each maternal tree for markers to be
placed within the same linkage group.  Inspection of the distribution of
silhouette values for values of $K$ ranging from \num{8} to \num{16} revealed
that $K = 12$ was the best clustering solution for each of the \num{4} maternal
trees (Figure S1). This was confirmed by comparison of pairwise LOD scores for
SNPs within versus among the \num{12} linkage groups. Comparisons within linkage
groups were on average 3.2-fold larger than among linkage groups, which was
significantly greater than expected randomly ($n = 1,000$ permutations/maternal
tree, $P < 0.015$).

Marker ordering within putative linkage groups using MSTmap resulted in
extremely long linkage maps (e.g., $>$ \SI{50000} {cM}) for each maternal tree.
This translated into an average number of recombination events which exceeded
\num{100} per megagametophyte. This pattern is consistent with problems of
inference due to missing data and genotyping errors \citep{Ward:2013}. To verify
this assumption, data for the blue library were split into two sets of \num{35}
megagametophytes - those with the least amount of missing data and those with
the largest amount of missing data. As expected, the inferred recombination
distances were 3.5-fold smaller for the maps inferred using the megagametophytes
with less missing data. Thus, we followed the approach of \citet{Ward:2013} to
impute and error correct data based on our initial marker orderings.

Imputation and error correction of genotype data for each linkage group for each
maternal tree was carried out using Maskov. This process drastically reduced the
number of inferred recombination events, including double crossovers, from
$>100$ per megagametophyte to approximately \num{1} to \num{2} per
megagametophyte. This reduction was controlled by setting a parameter in Maskov
so as to produce a number of recombination events per megagametophyte that
mirrored those observed previously for linkage mapping within conifers
\citep{Eckert:2009, Martinez-Garcia:2013}. Changing this parameter had no effect
on the downstream ordering of SNPs within linkage groups, but only changed the
spatial resolution of the resulting linkage map.

The resulting linkage maps for each maternal tree were aligned manually based on
the presence of shared contigs. Overall, there was excellent agreement among
maps, with only 115 SNPs being mapped to conflicting linkage groups across
maternal trees. All 115 SNPs with conflicting group assignments were unique to
the red library. These were dropped from further consideration.  Within linkage
groups, SNPs present in multiple libraries were ordered similarly (pairwise
Spearman's $\rho > 0.956, P < 0.001$), with conflicting orderings having average
differences of \num{5.91} cM ($\pm 5.64$ cM). Inferred linkage maps for
each maternal tree also resulted in SNPs from the same contig largely being
mapped to the same position, with an average of only 5.8\% of SNPs from the same
contig being mapped to a different position.  Approximately 94\% of the time,
these different positions were adjacent on the linkage map. For those SNPs from
the same contig that did not map to the same position, the average difference in
positioning was 1.64 cM ($\pm$ 3.01 cM), with no instances of SNPs from the same
contig being located on different linkage groups. We thus pruned multiple SNPs
per contig by randomly selecting one SNP per contig from the data set and
re-estimated the linkage maps for each maternal tree as described previously.
The resulting \num{4} linkage maps were taken as the final estimates of linkage
relationships among polymorphic contigs in each of the \num{4} maternal trees.

The final \num{4} linkage maps varied in total length from 1037.40 cM to 1572.80
cM, with an average of 1290.29 cM ($\pm$ 219.5 cM; Tables 2, S1-S4; Figures 3,
S2-S8).  In total, \num{20655} unique contigs representing \num{1931700} bp of
DNA were mapped to a position within at least one linkage map.  The number of
contigs varied 33.66-fold across linkage maps, with a minimum of 507 (red) to a
maximum of \num{17066} (yellow).  These contigs were organized into an average
of 741 ($\pm$ 335) unique positions, separated on average by 1.77 cM ($\pm$ 2.36
cM), across linkage maps, with the fewest number of unique positions observed in
the linkage map for the red maternal tree ($n = 296$) and the largest number in
the linkage map for the blue maternal tree ($n = 1101$). With respect to average
distances between adjacent positions, the linkage map for the red maternal tree
had the largest (5.53 cM $\pm$ 6.11 cM), while that for the blue maternal tree
had the lowest (1.16 cM $\pm$ 0.77 cM).  This translated into an average of 15
($\pm$ 27) contigs per position on average, with the linkage map for the red
maternal tree having the fewest contigs per position on average (2 $\pm$ 2) and
the linkage map for the yellow maternal tree the most contigs per position on
average (27 $\pm$ 35). Contigs were also non-randomly distributed across
positions for all linkage maps except that for the red maternal tree ($P <
0.0001$, see Supplemental Text), with elevated contig counts typically occurring
at the ends of linkage groups (Figure 3).

\subsection*{Consensus Map Construction and Biological Interpretation}

A set of 507 framework SNPs were devised from those contigs shared across at
least three of the four linkage maps. These 507 SNPs were used to construct a
framework map using MergeMap. The resulting linkage map had an overall length of
1572.80 cM. Comparison of this map with those for each maternal tree revealed a
strong similarity in positioning for each linkage group (Spearman's $\rho >
0.98, P < 0.001$).  Given this overall similarity, we incorporated the remaining
markers into the map by using weighted averages of observed pairwise
recombination fractions across maternal trees and inferred a consensus linkage
map as outlined previously. Inferred marker positions and distances for the
framework markers were highly correlated across linkage groups in this map
relative to that inferred using MergeMap and only the framework markers
(Mantel's $r: > 0.95, P < 0.001$). We used this as evidence in support of our
approach and the inferred consensus linkage map was taken as the final consensus
estimate of linkage relationships for the \num{20655} unique contigs located in
the four maternal tree linkage maps.

As with the individual tree maps, $K = 12$ linkage groups was most consistent
with the averaged data. This corresponded to a minimum pairwise LOD score of
approximately 5.5 for each maternal tree for markers to be placed within the
same linkage group.  The consensus linkage map was 1192.00 cM in length, with
linkage groups varying in length from 88.44 cM to 108.76 cM (Table S5). There
were 901 unique positions across the 12 linkage groups for this map, so that the
average number of contigs per position was 23 ($\pm$ 35). These 901 positions
were separated on average by 1.34 cM ($\pm$ 0.50 cM). As with the individual
maternal tree linkage maps, contigs were non-randomly distributed across
positions ($P < 0.0001$, see Supplemental Text), with notable enrichment at the
ends of inferred linkage groups. Using the 507 framework SNPs and the final
consensus linkage map, the estimated genome size of foxtail pine is 1276.04 cM
(95\% confidence interval: 1174.31 - 1377.77 cM). As such, the estimated
coverage of the genome is 98.58\% (LOD threshold = 5.5, maximum distance among
adjacent framework markers: 13.4 cM, number of framework markers: 507, $K =
2694$).

Of the \num{20655} contigs in the reference assembly which contained SNPs,
\num{5627} (27.2\%) contained BLAST hits ($n=5853$) which passed the filtering
threshold of 50\% query length and 75\% identity.  The averages of query length
(bp), query coverage percentage, and identity percentage were $94 \pm 7$,
$86.4\% \pm 13.0\%$, and $90.1\% \pm 3.9\%$, respectively. Of these hits, we
found 339 contigs with SNPs in annotated regions of the genome to which GO terms
have been attached. We found 0 GO terms associated with low-quality, partial
genes, where quality and completeness of the gene model were taken directly from
the loblolly pine scaffold to which homology in foxtail pine was established,
and 19 GO terms associated with low-quality, full-length genes. For the
high-quality set of annotated genes, we found 116 GO terms associated with
partial genes and 253 associated to whole genes.  The coincidence of GO terms is
summarized in Figure \ref{f:snp_venn}. We also consider valid hits to the genome
assembly in regions that are not annotated (regardless of annotation quality) as
putatively non-genic. Therefore, of the \num{5627} contigs containing SNPs, 94\%
($n=5288$) are in putatively non-genic regions of the genome.



\section*{Discussion}

The genetic architecture of fitness-related traits has been a major focus of
geneticists for over a century \citep[reviewed by][]{Ellegren:2008}.  Early
efforts to understand the genetic architecture of fitness-related traits focused
primarily on the number and effect size of the loci underlying heritable,
phenotypic variation \citep{Fisher:1918}.  Recent work has extended this line of
research, with a multitude of studies linking phenotypic with genetic variation through
linkage mapping, both within pedigrees \citep{Mauricio:2001, Neale:2011,
  Ritland:2011} and within natural populations \citep{Ingvarsson:2011,
  Eckert:2013a}, or through quantitative genetic experimentation
\citep{Anderson:2013a, Anderson:2013b, Fournier-Level:2013}. Relatively little
empirical work outside of model organisms, other than polyploidization in
plants, has focused on the genomic organization of loci contributing to fitness
differences among individuals \citep[but see][]{Stevison:2011}. This is despite
clear theoretical predictions relating the evolution of the genetic architecture
underlying fitness-related traits to the genomic organization of the loci
comprising this architecture \citep{Kirkpatrick:2006, Yeaman:2011, Yeaman:2013,
  Akerman:2014}.

Here, we have provided a high-density linkage map representing over 20,000 unique
contigs distributed throughout the 30 Gbp genome of foxtail pine that can be
used to aid in the discovery and study of loci contributing to local
adaptation. To our knowledge it represents one of the most dense linkage maps
ever produced within forest trees, although the number of unique positions is
much less than the number of mapped contigs (i.e., about
$1/20^{th}$). Approximately 25\% of these contigs had significant similarity to
sequences within the draft loblolly pine genome. Importantly, our markers are
dispersed in both genic and non-genic regions of the genome. The latter are
often ignored in studies of local adaptation utilizing markers based on sequence
capture \citep[e.g.,][]{Neves:2014} and SNP arrays
\citep[e.g.,][]{Eckert:2010a}, yet it is known that non-genic regions are often involved with adaptation \citep[e.g.,][]{Studer:2011}.
This linkage map, moreover, was created using
affordable next generation sequencing technologies in combination with freely-available
methods of analysis, which highlights the feasibility of this approach to
non-model conifers, where full genome sequencing and assembly are still not quite
feasible given realistic research budgets.  With regard to map integrity,
recombination fractions for pairs of SNPs segregating in multiple trees were
highly correlated (Mantel's \textit{r} $> 0.90$ for all comparisons across
linkage groups).  This allowed for the creation of a robust consensus linkage
map, as well as highlighted the biological signal of linkage apparent even in
noisy ddRADseq data. When coupled with the other biological signals in our
results (e.g., trees from the same regional population sharing SNPs more often),
we can be confident that our inferred linkage maps are based primarily on
biological, as opposed to statistical, signals. In further support of this
claim, randomly subsampling our data to represent \num{10000} contigs and performing
linkage mapping as described previously resulted in a consensus linkage map that
was indistinguishable from that pictured in Figure $3$ (Spearman's $\rho =
0.997, P < 0.0001$).

The linkage map produced here is valuable in numerous ways. First, it provides a
dense resource for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. Our next step using
this linkage map is to link fitness-related phenotypic variation with genotypes
at mapped markers. We are currently mapping QTLs for $\delta^{13}$C to
accomplish this goal \citep[cf.,][]{Hausmann:2005}. Importantly, this will represent one of the first QTL maps
in the clade of soft pines outside of section \textit{Quinquefoliae}. Second,
the framework provided here is optimal for imputation and phasing of data during
population genomic inferences utilizing samples from natural populations
\citep{Scheet:2006}.  Third, our linkage map is the foundation upon which
theoretical expectations can be tested.  For example, the theory of
\citet{Yeaman:2011} predicts that the loci contributing to local adaptation
should be differentially clustered in genomes as a function of rates of gene
flow among populations. Magnitudes of gene flow among stands differ dramatically
within the regional populations of foxtail pine, and pairwise plots of synteny
across maternal trees revealed several instances of differential marker
orderings between regional populations consistent with areas of the genome with
structural differences (see Figures S7-S8). These areas, however, were the
exception, as marker orderings across trees were highly correlated.  Fourth,
knowledge about the physical ordering of loci allows patterns of linkage
disequilibrium (LD) within natural populations to be better characterized. The
role of LD in local adaptation has long been recognized
\citep[see][]{Akerman:2014}, yet empirical studies of its role are difficult
without some knowledge of physical relationships among loci. This is because LD
among physically linked markers is expected to some degree, whereas LD among
physically unlinked markers must have originated from some evolutionary process
(e.g., genetic drift, natural selection). Patterns of LD across non-genic regions of pine
genomes are currently unknown \citep[but see][]{Moritsuka:2012}, so additional data in combination with the linkage
map provided here allow for rigorous investigations of these patterns. 
Lastly, continued production of
linkage maps across the Pinaceae will aid comparative genomics and evolutionary
inference through study of synteny and the evolution of genome structure
\citep{Ritland:2011}.

Despite numerous indicators of biological signals dominating our dataset, 
caution is still needed when interpreting our results. First, we used novel analysis
methods that have not been tested using simulations. For example, the form of
hierarchical clustering used here is not employed to our knowledge in any of the
available software packages used for linkage mapping. Thus, its utility on data
of smaller or larger sizes than that presented here is unknown. Consistency of
results across maternal trees, however, indicates that our methods are likely
appropriate for our data \citep[see also][]{Tani:2003}. Second, error-correction
and imputation were used, which could have affected marker ordering and
distances. Marker order, however, did not change with increasing stringency of
error correction. Only marker distances changed with increased stringency, thus
creating clumped distributions of makers. This was also apparent in the total
map length, which is at the lower end expected for conifers
\citep[cf.,][]{Ritland:2011}. The effect of marker clumping on downstream uses
of this linkage map, however, is likely to be minimal (e.g. bias in QTL
intervals), as this bias would affect QTL size and not necessarily inference of
QTL presence or absence. The relative importance of imputation and error
correction is to some degree affected by experimental conditions.  We did
not standardize the total amount of DNA for each megagametophyte prior to
construction of libraries (concentration ranges: \SIrange{10}{>50}{ng/ul},
which likely affected the average \num{19741}-fold variation in the number of reads
across megametophytes. Future studies would putatively benefit from considering
this prior to library construction. Third, we used a form of hierarchical
clustering that required the number of groups to be defined
subjectively. \textit{Post hoc} analysis indicated that our clustering solution
corresponded to a LOD threshold of approximately 5.5 and that 12 was an
optimal number of groups (Figure S1). Selection of a larger or smaller number of
groups, moreover, did not change marker ordering within groups substantially.
Typically, changing $K$ to a larger value broke existing linkage groups
into more pieces, whereas changing $K$ to smaller values merged existing linkage
groups. Marker orderings within these broken or merged groups, however, did not
change.  Lastly, our sample sizes were not large enough to resolve linkage
relationships beyond distances of approximately \SI{1.0}{cM} \citep[but
see][]{Neves:2014}. Increased number of sampled megagametophytes would have
allowed higher resolution, which could aid in downstream uses of our linkage
map. Despite this level of resolution, however, we have produced one of the
densest linkage maps to date for a forest tree species \citep{Eckert:2010b,
  Martinez-Garcia:2013, Neves:2014}.

Conifer genomics is emerging as a mature scientific field
\citep{Mackay:2012}. Draft sequences of genomes and transcriptomes for several
species have been released and more are planned. As shown here, production of
high-density linkage maps is a fruitful endeavor to accompany this
maturation. The results presented here are promising and also provide guidance
for future attempts in additional species.  Specifically, linkage maps provide
ample information about genomic structure that is needed for the study of local
adaptation in natural populations \citep[cf.,][]{Limborg:2014}. Here, we have
produced a high-density linkage map for foxtail pine using methods applicable to
any non-model conifer species, thus opening the door for further studies of
genome structure and the genetic architecture of local adaptation in this rather
understudied clade of pines, as well as the Pinaceae as a whole.

\subsection*{Supplementary Text}\label{ss:supp}

A nonparametric permutation analysis was used to test the hypothesis that
sharing of polymorphic contigs was greater between maternal trees located in the
same regional population. The null hypothesis in this case is that the degree of
sharing between trees in the same regional population is not different than
between trees in different regional populations. To conduct this test, we
constructed a null distribution of the difference between mean within versus
mean between levels of contig sharing. This distribution was based on
permutations, where each permutation consisted of randomly sampling with
replacement contigs from the full set of contigs prior to filtering for each
maternal tree identifier. The number of each contigs for each maternal tree
identifier was equal to that observed in the original dataset. Given these
assignments, the degree of sharing (DS) between trees was calculated as:

DS = number of contigs shared/number of unique contigs in the pairwise
comparison

Given four maternal trees, there are 6 pairwise comparisons, of which there are
2 within regional population and 4 between regional population
comparisons. Using these pairwise values, we constructed a test statistic
defined as the difference between the mean within regional population value of
DS and the mean between regional population value of DS. We simulated
\num{10000} values of this test statistic to form the null distribution and
rejected the null hypothesis when the observed test statistic fell in the upper
95\% tail of this null distribution (i.e., a one-tailed test). Using this
approach, the observed test statistic was 0.06337814. The limits of the
simulated null distribution were -0.0349 to 0.0415. Thus the observed test
statistic fell completely outside the upper tail of the null distribution, which
gives $P < 0.0001$.

The spatial distribution of contigs along linkage groups was tested against
complete spatial randomness using simulations.  Specifically, we used the
variance in the observed number of contigs mapped to each unique position across
the entire linkage map as the test statistic. The null distribution of the test
statistic was created by simulating \num{10000} Poisson-distributed variables,
each with the number of random values equal to the number of unique positions on
the linkage map under consideration and the mean equal to the mean number of
contigs per position. For each Poisson-distributed variable, the variance was
calculated. The set of $10000$ variances was used as the null distribution
expected under complete spatial randomness. A separate null distribution was
constructed for each maternal tree. If the observed variance fell in either the
2.5\% or 97.5\% tail of the null distribution, the null hypothesis was
rejected. For example, the values used for the consensus linkage map were:
observed variance $= 1245.423$, average expected variance of Poisson-distributed
variable $= 23$ with $95\%$ CI of null expectation of 20.915--25.246, and limits
of the null distribution of 19.214--27.655.  The $P$-value for the observed
variance is thus $P < 0.0001$.

This test does not explicitly test spatial randomness of the unique positions on
a linkage map, but rather tests the assumption that the intensities (i.e., the
number of mapped contigs) at each position follow a Poisson distribution.  This
approach was chosen because distances in the inferred linkage maps were
sensitive the error correction and imputation. Of course, the number of contigs
at each mapped position is also sensitive to this process, although relaxing the
error correction parameter in Maskov resulted in similar results for a range of
values that resulted in realistic linkage map lengths (i.e., total lengths $<
\SI{3000}{cM}$. Thus, we were confident that this result is not only a function
of error correction and imputation. All linkage maps except for the single-tree
map from the red maternal tree had greater than expected variances across
positions in counts of mapped contigs relative to the null model of a
Poisson-distributed variable.
